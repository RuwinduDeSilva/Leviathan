#Levoathan 0 to 1
In overthewire wargames site, leviathan 0 page provides the user name and password ro the leviathan 0

Using the "ls" command we can find there is another derectory called ".backup".
Inside of that there is a html file with full of text. So to retrieve the password we use cat command with grep by giveing a keyword as password.

Leviathan 1 pic

The password for the next level is **"rioGegei8m"**

#Bandit 1 to 2
We have retrived the password for this level in previous level.

Using "ls" command we found that there is an exicutable file and executed it. It has protected with password and probably it may contains the password for the next level. To check which function the executable runs we uses the command "ltrace". We can see it runs "strcmp()" function and it compare the user input with the string "sex" and that means the password for that is "sex".

It guids us to another session and by entering "whoami" it says that it is leviathan2. So by entering quick "cat" command we can find the password for the next level.

#Leviathan 2 to 3
We have located an executable file called printfile in the "/home/leviathan2". When we execute that it requires a text file to continue. So We creates a .txt file at /tmp/ans/ derectory and ryn the executable with ltrace. It shows that access() does is check permissions based on the processâ€™ real user ID rather than the effective user ID. Using that vulnerability we get the password for the next level.

#Leviathan 3 to 4

Here we can find an executable file called "level3" and whrn it runs it requires a password. To get to know what string is the function is looking for, in other words that is the password, we enter the "strings" command nad it outputs all the strings that contains in the file "level3".

```
leviathan3@melinda:~$ strings ./level3

```
Here, clear text before "[You've got shell]!" text, "snlp" and "rintf" is suspicious as the password and we tried that and it gaves a new shell and it is Leviathan4 shell.
By giveing a symple cat command to "/etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4" file we can retrieve the password for the next level.

```
$ whoami
leviathan4
$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4
